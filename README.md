# Credit-Card-EDA
#Problem Statement 
#Business Understanding: Two types of risks are associated with the bankâ€™s decision:
#-> If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
#-> If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
#The data given in application_data.csv file contains the information about the loan application at the time of applying for the loan.
#It contains two types of scenarios:
#-> The client with payment difficulties, he/she had late payment more than X days on at least one of the first Y instalments of the loan in our sample,
#-> All other cases: All other cases when the payment is paid on time.
#When a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the client/company):
#-> Approved: The Company has approved loan Application
#-> Cancelled: The client cancelled the application sometime during approval. Either the client changed her/his mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher risk of the client he received worse pricing which he did not want.
#-> Refused: The company had rejected the loan (because the client does not meet their requirements etc.).
#-> Unused offer:  Loan has been cancelled by the client but on different stages of the process.
#In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
#The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
